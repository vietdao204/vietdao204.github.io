I'm currently studying statistics under [Dr. Laura Cowen](https://cowenlab.weebly.com){:target='_blank'}'s supervision at the [University of Victoria](https://uvic.ca){:target='_blank'} (UVic), where we are working on estimating hidden COVID-19 population using capture-recapture methods. Before UVic, I was at [SoFi](https://sofi.com){:target='_blank'} doing [growth engineering](https://www.saxifrage.xyz/post/growth-engineering){:target='_blank'}. I got my undergraduate degree in computer science and statistics from [Gustavus Adolphus College](https://gustavus.edu){:target='_blank'}.
