I'm currently studying statistics under [Dr. Laura Cowen](https://cowenlab.weebly.com)'s supervision at the [University of Victoria](https://uvic.ca) (UVic), where we are working on estimating hidden COVID-19 population using capture-recapture methods. Before UVic, I was at [SoFi](https://sofi.com) doing [growth engineering](https://www.saxifrage.xyz/post/growth-engineering). I got my undergraduate degree in computer science and statistics from [Gustavus Adolphus College](https://gustavus.edu).
